# sync-skills.sh — generate Claude Code skill wrappers under
# .claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md for every skill in .ai-context/skills/
# (universal) and .ai-context/teams/backend/skills/ (team-owned — this
# is a backend-team repo) that declares a `command:` field in its
# frontmatter.
#
# Each wrapper is a one-line pointer to the canonical SKILL.md in
# ai-context. Prose updates upstream propagate without anything to
# regenerate here.
#
# Team-owned skill directories that only override assets (no SKILL.md
# of their own — e.g. teams/backend/skills/spec/assets/) are skipped
# naturally, since the glob below requires a SKILL.md to be present.
#
# Idempotent: existing wrappers are skipped, never overwritten or
# deleted.
#
# Per-repo skills under .agents/skills/ are not scanned — those are
# managed manually.
#
# Normally invoked via `make sync-skills`.
